## PowerBI

For my sabatical project, I'll be using PowerBI as a data visualization & dashboarding tool, since the College uses Microsoft products and Accounts, simplifying access, security and hopefully development. 

Working to draft a number of different views across pages for the display of different data for the project. 

[This article](https://powerbi.tips/2019/08/dynamic-visuals-using-buttons/) on using buttons in PowerBI to change what graphs or visuals are displayed is going to be helpful I think. 

Microsoft's Online training for PowerBI is acutally quite usable & comprehensive. It's built out into a number of scaffolding modules and units that introduce you to the features, terminology and methods PowerBI uses. You can view it [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/browse/?expanded=power-platform&products=power-bi).

* [Grouping and Binning Values](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-grouping-and-binning)
* [Buttons](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-buttons)
Often used in conjunction with [Booksmarks]().
* [Drill-Through Reports](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-drillthrough) & [Drill-Through Buttons](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-drill-through-buttons)

### Terminology

There's a lot of terminology used by PowerBI and I've found the terms to be a little unclear
