# Python Libraries & modules

A collection of the python libraries I've used and notes about their usage or performance.

## notes on the built-in/standards libraries
(that I haven't written about elsewhere)

### regular expressions

* [re docs] (https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)
* [Regular Expressions in Python (realpython.com)] (https://realpython.com/regex-python/)
a detailed article that scaffolds a bit fast, but has a lot of detail. Useful to have the same complex topic explained twice.

#### replace: 
* [re.sub docs] (https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.sub)
* [re.sub howto] (https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html#search-and-replace) 

### subproccess
* [subprocess docs] ()

## external libraries & modules
* PDFminer.six

A module for processing and handling PDF documents. I was mostly interested in its ability to extract plaintext from PDF documents for my sabbatical project. It did this well enough for general use but the original document's formatting prevents the extraction from being good enough for my purposes.
